# Earthquake Visualization
Description
-------
With all the magnitude 6+ earthquakes that have been happening around the globe during recent months, it is useful to be able to visualize all earthquakes on a map in real time. This web-based earthquake visualization helps to identify all the earthquakes that happened up to seven days in the past on a 3D globe. It also has the functionality of updating new earthquakes in real time if new earthquake information is received. To further enhance the usability, it included a filter system to filter earthquakes based on magnitude and a predefined date range (up to 7 days). The visualization is built on top of WebGL Earth, an alternative to WebGL Globe that also utilizes WebGL technology. The application is based on JavaScript and Bootstrap Framework for the front-end and PHP for the back-end. Running retrieveEarthquakeJson.php will retrieve earthquake JSON data from the USGS database, which will update earthquake info every five minutes. The communication between Javascript and backend PHP will be based on an API file called api.php. Through this PHP file, browser can verify the MD5 value of its current JSON data to see if it is up to date, and retrieve any latest JSON data if necessary. For the front-end, it uses JQuery to make API calls and Google CryptoJS to get the MD5 value of the data.

Installation
-------
1. Copy all the files into public_html folder.
2. Use CRON to run retrieveEarthquakeJson.php as a schedule. The intervial should be within every FIVE minutes in order to have the up to date earthquakes data.
3. Done.
